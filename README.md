### Introduction
Soil has been referred to as the most complex biomaterial on earth (Young and Crawford 2004), this complexity is increased when the focus is on the plant-soil interface. It is well understood that soil structure and soil biota influence soil health and that plant root architecture and root exudates are influential. The most obvious way that plant roots change soil structure is through physical force. As a plant root navigates through the soil it changes not just the physical structure but also the chemical and biological properties in its immediate vicinity (Hinsinger 2009). During root growth a distinct volume of soil often adheres to the plant root called the rhizosheath, and immediately adjacent to this is an area of soil called the rhizosphere that is distinctly different to bulk soil which is further away from the root system. The rhizosheath and rhizosphere have a very interesting implication: they show that a small volume of soil that is close too, but not touching, the root system can have different structural, chemical, and biological properties to near-by bulk soil. In this distinct volume of soil, bacteria form microaggregates by binding soil particles together with their secretions (Ingham 2009). Examples of root morphology include the presence and size of root hairs, the length of roots along with their branching properties. Examples of rhizosheath properties include the amount of soil adhering to the root and root hairs along the with the proportion of the root covered in soil. Rhizosheath soil can also have a different pore network, different soil aggregate sizes and microbial community. These root and rhizosheath traits change a plants capacity to uptake water and nutrients allowing the plant to tolerate water deficits, heat stress and limited nutrient availability.

A popular tool for understanding the root soil interface is MicroCT. For example, Duddek et al., (2023) created custom chambers to grow roots into small chambers so that they could image maize roots at a resolution where they could identify root hairs. However, without some sort of destructive technique there is no clear way to distinguish rhizosheath. This is because by definition the rhizosheath is the volume of soil that adheres to the root system after being excavated and shaken to remove non-adhering bulk soil (Brown et al., 2017). Therefore, rhizosphere refers to the soil affected by the root activities, which by definition includes the rhizosheath. So, rhizosheath is a portion of the rhizospheric soil that remains on the roots after being taken out from the soil (Cheraghi et al., 2023). In other words, it is now agreed that every rhizosheath soil volume is rhizosphere, but not all rhizosphere soil is rhizosheath. 
Rhizosheath formation is underpinned by 4 key processes, in no order: <br>
1) the properties of host soil <br>
2) mucilage and exudate deposits from the plant roots <br>
3) microbial activity <br>
4) root hairs <br>
<br>
Together these root-soil traits should create an environment that is ideal for plant growth. A simple model of rhizosheath formation is that root hairs navigate the soil pore space and adhere to soil aggregates, the adhesion is secured by mucilage (a sticky substances excreted by the plant roots) and this forms the basis of the rhizosheath. Overtime microorganisms consume exudates creating textural biomaterial along with necro mass which further adds to the rhizosheath formation.

The benefit of using a synchrotron for MicroCT is speed. For example, Duddek et al., (2023) needed to cut off their small root chambers prior to scanning. In a conventional desk top CT scanner, the scan time would be so long such that the root and root hairs would desiccate. However, give the scan time is less than 10 minutes the artefacts from a destructive harvest are minimal. Another example of the benefit of using a synchrotron is studying leaves, leaves can be quickly chopped, wrapped in Kapton tape and imaged before they dried out. Here we show how the established methods for imaging leaves can be leveraged to image the rhizosheath. We extract the rhizosheath, quickly and delicately wrap it in Kapton tape and image the rhizosheath, all within a few minutes. We then take this 3D structural information to better understand the mechanisms behind rhizosheath formation. To complement this, we include lower resolution data to compare the rhizosheath to the rhisozphere 

### Methods
Plant Growth:
Plants were grown in a constant temperature room. We chose to explore the following plants:

| Plant:  | Justification: |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Wheat (W1) | Longer more dense root hairs  |
| Wheat (W16)  | Shorter less dense root hairs  |
| Barley WT | Barley with root hairs  |
| Barley Baldy  | Barley root hair mutant (no root hairs)  |

Extraction and Sample preparation:
The root system was delicately removed from a 15mm irrigation riser (custom pot) and gently shaken to separate rhizosphere and bulk soil from the rhizosheath. A representative piece of root with rhizosheath soil was sampled with a razor blade and delicately wrapped in Kapton.
